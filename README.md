# Project Title

1. Starwars Data Analysis
2. Lakers Data Analysis
3. Superstore Data Analysis

## Description

1. I analyzed the traits of characters using Pivot tables and Descriptive Statistics. With the extracted data, I created a visualization dashboard to provide an easy-to-understand representation of the characters' characteristics.
2. I analyzed data from LA Lakers games, including points, type, result, player, and etype and created a visualization of dots on the court to represent the location of each made or missed 3-point shot. I also developed a dashboard to allow for easy access and exploration of the data.
3. I analyzed Superstore data using Pivot tables to create a graph forecast of sales. I also developed a visualization dashboard to provide an easy way to view and understand the Superstore data.
