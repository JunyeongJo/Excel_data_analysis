## Description

1. I analyzed the traits of characters using Pivot tables and Descriptive Statistics. With the extracted data, I created a visualization dashboard to provide an easy-to-understand representation of the characters' characteristics.
2. I analyzed data from LA Lakers games, including points, type, result, player, and etype and created a visualization of dots on the court to represent the location of each made or missed 3-point shot. I also developed a dashboard to allow for easy access and exploration of the data.
3. I analyzed Superstore data using Pivot tables to create a graph forecast of sales. I also developed a visualization dashboard to provide an easy way to view and understand the Superstore data.
4. 
5. I analyzed public bike data to determine the most popular places to rent a bike and to understand the usage patterns by gender, total number of rental locations, and age group. I also created a density chart overlayed on a map of Seoul to identify the regions with the highest bike usage.
6. I analyzed personal loan data to determine the key factors for loan approval using box plots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis.
7. 
8. I investigated the issues and complaints of users while playing the game by creating a chart of the most frequently used negative words in user reviews and a chronological chart to identify peak review periods.
